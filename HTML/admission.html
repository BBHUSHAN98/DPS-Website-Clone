          <p>Online Registration for provisional admission to Class XI in academic session 2024-25 will commence on Friday, March 01, 2024, as per the Admission Schedule given below.</p>
          <p>For your benefit, we have uploaded the list of subjects / streams available in our school, subject to adequate number of applicants.</p>
          <p>The present education system is undergoing a major change with the implementation of New Education Policy (NEP-2020), National Credit Framework (NCrF-2022) and National Curriculum Framework (NCF-2023). The policies broadly emphasize that there will be no hard separation between academic or vocational streams. Hence, integration & mainstreaming of vocational education with general education is being aimed. This shall lead to re-engineering of education system. To achieve this, the board is proposing multi-disciplinarity and holistic education across Sciences, Social Sciences, Arts, Humanities, Commerce and Sports/ Vocational or Skill Subjects in Class XI & XII.</p>
          <p>As per the recent webinar conducted by CBSE, the board plans to implement this from 2024-25 in Class XI, but it has still not come out with the final proposition. <br> However, the School, intends to keep you updated with the expected changes in face of implementation of the above-mentioned policies. To start with, the school may not be able to implement the changes in totality considering constraints like availability of subjects, faculty, number of class rooms etc.</p>
          <p>At this stage, in absence of confirmation from the board, we shall follow the old system of choosing streams. However, if any change is implemented by the board in the coming months, we shall abide by the board’s directives, which may result in change of one subject in the existing stream and addition of one language native to India.</p>
          <p>Do note that no queries will be entertained over the telephone or in person, hence please refrain from visiting or calling up the school to clarify about the provisional admission process.</p>
          <p>For any clarification / query, you may write to admissions@dpspune.com.</p>
          <p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>No change in date / time of any of the admission-related processes will be allowed. Requests for changing the date / time will not be responded to. If you cannot adhere to the schedule, please do not register.</li>
